# Machine-Learning

A (WIP) list of Machine Learning algorithms in Python. Currently includes the following algorithms:

1. k-Nearest Neighbors ([Read More](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2016/12/25/k-nearest-neighbors/))

2. kMeans

  1. Includes Silhouetting to find number of clusters, scikit-learn required
  
  2. Includes plotting, which requires matplotlib
 
3. Perceptron ([Perceptron Theory](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/perceptron-theory/))
 
4. Least Squares
 
  1. Requires numpy
  
  2. Includes plotting, which requires matplotlib

5. Naive Bayes Classifier ([Read more on Categorical](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2016/12/09/naive-categorical-bayes-classifier-intro/), ([Read more on Numerical](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2016/12/17/naive-numerical-bayes-classifier-introduction/))
  
  1. Includes Categorical and Numerical classifiers

6. Neural Network
 
  1. Currently built with PyBrain, working on a "from-scratch" release
