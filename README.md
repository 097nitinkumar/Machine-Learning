# Machine-Learning

A (WIP) list of Machine Learning algorithms in Python. Currently includes the following algorithms:

### Classifiers

1. k-Nearest Neighbors ([Blog Post](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2016/12/25/k-nearest-neighbors/))
 
2. Perceptron ([Theory](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/perceptron-theory/), [Implementation](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2017/02/05/perceptron-implementation/))
 
3. Least Squares
 
  1. Requires numpy
  
  2. Includes plotting, which requires matplotlib

4. Naive Bayes Classifier ([Categorical](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2016/12/09/naive-categorical-bayes-classifier-intro/), [Numerical](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2016/12/17/naive-numerical-bayes-classifier-introduction/))
  
  1. Includes Categorical and Numerical classifiers

5. Neural Network
 
  1. Requires numpy
  
  2. Includes plotting, which requires matplotlib

### Clustering

1. kMeans
  
  1. Includes plotting, which requires matplotlib
  
  2. Includes both the online (or sequential) kMeans and the standard (or iterative) algorithm.
