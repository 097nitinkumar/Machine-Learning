# Machine-Learning

A list of Machine Learning algorithms. Currently includes the following algorithms:

1) k-Nearest Neighbors

2) kMeans

  *includes Silhouetting to find number of clusters, scikit-learn required
  
  *includes plotting, which requires matplotlib
 
 3) Perceptron
 
 4) Least Squares
 
  *needs numpy
  
  *includes plotting, which requires matplotlib
 
 5) Neural Network
 
  *currently built with PyBrain, working on a "from-scratch" release
