# Machine-Learning

A (WIP) list of Machine Learning algorithms in Python. Currently includes the following algorithms:

1. k-Nearest Neighbors ([Read More](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2016/12/25/k-nearest-neighbors/))

2. kMeans

  1. includes Silhouetting to find number of clusters, scikit-learn required
  
  2. includes plotting, which requires matplotlib
 
3. Perceptron ([Perceptron Theory](https://algorithmsandstuff.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/perceptron-theory/))
 
4. Least Squares
 
  1. needs numpy
  
  2. includes plotting, which requires matplotlib
 
5. Neural Network
 
  1. currently built with PyBrain, working on a "from-scratch" release
