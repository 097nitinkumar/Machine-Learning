# Machine-Learning

A (WIP) list of Machine Learning algorithms in Python. Currently includes the following algorithms:

1. k-Nearest Neighbors

2. kMeans

  1. includes Silhouetting to find number of clusters, scikit-learn required
  
  2. includes plotting, which requires matplotlib
 
3. Perceptron
 
4. Least Squares
 
  1. needs numpy
  
  2. includes plotting, which requires matplotlib
 
5. Neural Network
 
  1. currently built with PyBrain, working on a "from-scratch" release
